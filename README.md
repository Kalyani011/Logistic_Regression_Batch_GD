# Logistic_Regression_Batch_GD
Logistic Regression with Batch Gradient Descent to perform binary classification

Implementation of simple Logistic Regression for binary classification, by minimizing Cross Entropy Loss using Batch Gradient Descent.
LogisticRegression.py consists of methods for tasks such as data splitting, calculating hypothesis, calculating cost, performing gradient descent and predicting classes.
classify_and_compare.py runs the local implementation and sklearn implementation of Logistic Regression and compares the accuracy of the two implementations.
